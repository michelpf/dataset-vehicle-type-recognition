# Vehicle Type Recognition

This dataset was originally downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggleashwin/vehicle-type-recognition).

The goal of this repository is to facilitate the teaching of Python classes with organized data.

The dataset is organized into four classes, each representing a different type of vehicle:

* Car: Images of different car models and types, captured from various angles and under different lighting conditions.
* Truck: Images of different types of trucks, including pickup trucks, delivery trucks, and heavy-duty trucks.
* Bus: Images of buses used for public transportation, school buses, and other types of buses.
* Motorcycle: Images of motorcycles and motorbikes.

The metric value represents the number of mentions for a given ticker symbol every 5 minutes.

This dataset was adapted for use in Machine Learning classes.
